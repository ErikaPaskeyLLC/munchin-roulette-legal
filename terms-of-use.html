  <h3>1. Use of the App</h3>

  <h3>2. Location & Third-Party Data</h3>
  <p>The App uses your device location (ZIP or GPS) only to retrieve restaurant data via the Yelp API. We do not collect or store your location data. Yelp’s data may be inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete. We are not responsible for Yelp’s data or your experience at suggested businesses.</p>

  <h3>3. In-App Purchases</h3>
  <p>The App may offer paid features or upgrades, processed securely through the Google Play Store or Apple App Store. All payments are final and non-refundable except where required by law or if the App is completely nonfunctional. No payment information is collected or stored by us.</p>

  <h3>4. Limitation of Liability</h3>
  <p>We are not liable for any losses, dissatisfaction, or harm resulting from use of the App, including issues related to restaurant selection, quality, or experiences at third-party businesses. All decisions and interactions are your responsibility.</p>
